<h2>Problem</h2>
<P>Websites experience fluctuating traffic patterns influenced by user behavior, seasonal trends, and external events. Without accurate forecasting, businesses struggle with server overloads, downtime, and inefficient resource allocation. This unpredictability impacts user experience, conversion rates, and overall business performance.</P>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Session primary channel group: The marketing channel (e.g., Direct, Organic Social)</li>
  <li>Date + hour (YYYYMMDDHH): The specific date and hour of the session</li>
  <li>Users: Number of users in a given time period</li>
  <li>Sessions: Number of sessions in that period</li>
  <li>Engaged sessions: Number of sessions with significant user engagement</li>
  <li>Average engagement time per session: The average time a user is engaged per session</li>
  <li>Engaged sessions per user: Ratio of engaged sessions to total sessions per user</li>
  <li>Events per session: Average number of events (actions taken) per session</li>
  <li>Engagement rate: The proportion of sessions that were engaged</li>
  <li>Event count: Total number of events during the period</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>This project applies time series forecasting models—ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet—to analyze website performance and predict future traffic trends. The approach includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values and anomalies.</li>

<li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, seasonality, and anomalies in website </li>

<li>Forecasting: Implementing ARIMA for short-term predictions, SARIMA for seasonal patterns, and Prophet for long-term trends.</li>

<li>Model Evaluation: Comparing performance using RMSE and MAPE to ensure accurate predictions</li>
</ul>
